# Introduction to SettlerEngine

SettlerEngine is a protocol-agnostic settlement layer for the next generation of commerce, serving both human users and autonomous AI agents.

## Core Concepts

- **x402 Protocol:** Handshake and verification lifecycle for machine-to-machine payments.
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Decoupling domain core from external infrastructure.
- **Statelessness:** Relying on cryptographic signatures and the blockchain as the source of truth.

## Getting Started

Refer to the internal modules and the `settler-proxy` for integration details.
