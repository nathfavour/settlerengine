# x402 Protocol

The x402 protocol is a machine-to-machine payment protocol that leverages the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code.

## Flow

1. **Intercept:** The gateway catches an unauthenticated request.
2. **Challenge:** A 402 response is returned with a cryptographic nonce.
3. **Sign:** The agent signs an `IntentToPay` message.
4. **Verify:** The engine verifies the signature and allows the request to proceed.
